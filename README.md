Predicting model for NYC trip duration(supervised model) capstone project
The dataset I have used is available at Kaggle live, and its related information was collected over the years along with certain dependencies and provided to the public for further analysis. We used a collection of these datasets, which depicted around 3 years of NYC taxi trip data - about 15 lakhs records were considered, which carried the information of Taxi trips.Considering various Machine Learning models that provide reliable and improved accuracy for prediction-based use-cases and MLP are taken into consideration due to their novel potentiality to accumulate complex component conditions. Successful prediction of the taxi trip duration would eventually be much useful in the future to make better taxi trip duration predictions applicable to multiple cities.
